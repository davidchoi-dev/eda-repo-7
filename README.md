    period: 1996.07.01 ~ 2020.06.29(25 years)

team: 이태헌, 김희주

## Backtesting
* As the purpose of this project is for study, we didn't consider dividends, rebalancing and just focused on the indices of the close data in traditional all-weather-portfolio.

### 1. Understanding of 5 Indices close data
- Analyzed weekly return and cumulative return by asset types(stock, long-term bond, mid-term bond, commodity, gold)

### 2. Traditional Asset Allocation Portfolio
   - Visualized and Compared traditional asset allocation portfolio.
        - portfolio_1 : stock 100%
        - portfolio_2 : stock 60% + long-term bond 40%
        - portfolio_3 : All_Weather : stock 30% + long-term bond 40% + mid-term bond 15% + commodity 7.5% + gold 7.5%

### 3. Trend Analysis about Rate of Cumulative Return by the Portfolios
   - All_weather portfolio doesn't seem to be the best portfolio in terms of investment, since the rate of cumulative return is 170% over the last 25 years even though it's safer than any others. 
   - Therefore, we assumed that it would be valuable to build a new portfolio that is able to make more returns as maintaining the safeness of All_Weather portfolio.
    
### 4. Compose New Portfolio
   - Composed New Portfolios based on traditional all-weather portfolio increasing the weight of the assets which are more correlated with SP_500(stock) 
        - all_weather2 :  stock 30% + long-term bond 40% + mid-term bond 5% + commodity 5% + gold 20%
        - all_weather3 :  stock 40% + long-term bond 30% + mid-term bond 5% + commodity 5% + gold 20%
        - all_weather4 :  stock 50% + long-term bond 20% + mid-term bond 5% + commodity 5% + gold 20%
        - all_weather5 :  stock 50% + long-term bond 20% + mid-term bond 10% + commodity 5% + gold 15%

## Conclusion
- It is found that All-weather portfolio 4(stock 50%, long_bond 20%, mid_bond 5%, commodity 5%, gold 20%) is the best 'assest allocation portfolio' to increase returns with the limited risk of loosing investment, given that All-weather portfolio 4 is the second highest score in CAGR and Worst year is twice as small as Stock100.
